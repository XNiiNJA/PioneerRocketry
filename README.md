# Pioneer Rocketry Repository!

This repository is for everything Pioneer Rocketry on the electronics side. 
___
Currently, the 2015 competiton code and 2016 competition code is all we have. 

The current competiton code is in the 2016 folder. 

A couple of guidelines to keep this repo nice and clean:

1. Make sure your code can be downloaded and compiled with only changing a few settings on the IDE at most. Make sure your libraries are all included and everything works. This makes it so we are able to move forward with development quickly and easily.
2. Don't commit something if it doesn't work. That just makes more work for us instead of less. Make sure your code works before commit. Unless of course it's your first commit to a new project. 
3. Use common sense. That way I don't have to think of more rules. 

There you go. Get out there and make something cool. 

Also, remember to have fun!
