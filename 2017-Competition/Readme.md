Welcome to the 2017 Competition repository!

In order to try implementing a true software process there have been created different repositories. 

* Exploritory
  * Prototyping and testing ways of implementing go here. This can be as clean or as messy as we see fit. Lessons learned from this code shall be documented here as well. 
* 01_Planning 
  * Everything for the planning stage goes here. Hardware plans, software plans, coding standards, lifecycle stage plans. 
2. 02_System
  * Everything for documenting the agreed upon hardware level plans goes here.
3. 03_Requirements
  * Everything for documenting high-level software requirements, including derived requirements. Software Requirements Document (SwRD) shall be created as well.
4. 04_Design
  * Everything for documenting low-level software requirements, along with other design documents. A Software Design Document (SwDD) shall be created.
5. 05_Code
  * The *Actual Code* goes here. Along with any tool necessary for creating said code. 
6. 06_Integration
  * Releases of the code goes here (aka zips of the code folder). Only fully working stable builds, or adhoc builds, go in this folder. Releases are planned events. 
7. 07_Analysis
  * Any analysis (timing, throughput, etc.) of the code goes here. 
8. 08_Testing
  * Results of tests, and the actual tests themselves go here. (We might not get this far. We can hope!)

This folder structure was made by Esterline Avista, so it's been tried and tested. They do have more folders above just this, so maybe we can add some of those too. However, those are mainly for book-keeping purposes, which we already do in Google Drive. I have also added the Exploritory directory, which is usually in the 05_Code directory, then it becomes demoted  and moved to an Obsolete directory within 05_Code. I feel like we might not do that and go forward with the prototype code, which is bad. This forces us to start over.

A couple of ground rules: 

1. ***Don't make new "branches" (or directories) all willy nilly.*** It makes the repository a mess and doesn't make it clear as to where the code we need is. This can result in lost work and lost time if we can't find something we need. Just don't do it. 
  * If we do come across a serious problem with our structure, we will have a team meating to decide the best way to fix the issue. 
   
  * This problem seems to stem from using Subversion, or not knowing how to properly make branches in git. We should look into making training for git on the Wiki.

2. Let's try using the tools that github has built in, such as the issue tracker and the wiki. Real tools like these will be used in the real world and having practice is always a good idea!
